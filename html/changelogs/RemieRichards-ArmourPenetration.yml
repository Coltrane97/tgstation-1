changes: 
  - tweak: "Cumulative armour damage resistance is now capped at 90%, you will now always take at bare minimum, 10% of the incoming damage."
  - rscadd: "Added a system for Armour Penetration to items, it works by temporarily (It does NOT damage the armour or anything) reducing the armour values by the AP value during the attack instance."
  - rscadd: "The formula for AP is Armour-ArmourPenetration = AdjustedArmour and AdjustedArmour is used for all the remaining calculations instead of Armour (Eg: 80 Melee - 15 AP = 65 Melee)."
  - rscadd: "The Ninja's Energy Katana has 15 AP, Xenomorphs have an inbuilt AP of 10."
