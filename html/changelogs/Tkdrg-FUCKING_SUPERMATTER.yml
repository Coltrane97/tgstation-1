Known as the 'supermatter shard', it is a fragment of an ancient alien artifact, believed to have a dangerous and mysterious power. This precious item has been made available to the Space Station 13 cargo team for the cost of a hundred supply points, as a reward for all your hard work. Good luck, and stay safe."
