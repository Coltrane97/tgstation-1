changes: 
  - tweak: "Crew monitoring: The minimap now supports scaling. You can zoom in and out using the buttons. Hovering over an entry in the table centers the minimap on that part of the screen."
  - tweak: "Crew monitoring: If the window is wide enough the health indicator will expand to show full health data (if available)."
  - tweak: "Crew monitoring: Clicking on the area name will now copy the coordinates to your clipboard."
  - tweak: "Crew monitoring: The AI can view health information again, but there is a 5 second delay between updates for everyone watching."
